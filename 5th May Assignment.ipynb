    "Time-dependent seasonal components in time series data refer to patterns that exhibit variations or fluctuations at specific time points or intervals. These variations tend to repeat regularly over time and are associated with specific seasons or periods. Unlike static seasonal components that have consistent patterns across different time periods, time-dependent seasonal components allow for more flexibility by allowing the seasonal effects to change over time."
